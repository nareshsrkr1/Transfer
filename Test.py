Perfect — that’s a great direction 👏

Let’s structure this clearly for your email — with Phase 1 (Technical Intelligence) and Phase 2 (Business Intelligence) sections, each with a vision, approach, and expected outcome.

Below is a polished version you can copy directly into an email or proposal format 👇

GenAI Integration Proposal for 165(d) Wind-Down Tool

Context

Our application processes and reports on liquidity and stress testing data as part of the 165(d) regulatory framework.
We receive trade and position data from the TPD team, and stress scenario data from the MARS team, which are unified to form consolidated position data.
Post data preparation, the system triggers Transcend for stress test execution, customizes RLEN runs, and generates reports for the Liquidity team.

We are exploring opportunities to integrate Generative AI (GenAI) for both technical efficiency and business insights.

Phase 1: Technical Intelligence Layer

Vision

Build a GenAI-powered observability and summarization layer that learns from daily batch executions and provides human-like insights on operational performance, anomalies, and trends.

Key Objectives

1. Daily Batch Summarization (RAG-Based Model)

Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that ingests batch logs, run statistics, and status data from historical runs.

The model should generate:

Daily summaries (“All 4 scenarios ran successfully; batch completed 20% faster than yesterday”).

Error explanations (“Scenario FedSA failed due to missing stress inputs for repo trades”).

Trend analytics (“Average batch duration reduced by 8% week-over-week”).




2. Historical Insight Retrieval

Enable natural-language queries over historical data:
“Show me all failed runs in the last month.”
“Compare today’s RLEN results with last Monday.”



3. Anomaly & Deviation Detection

Automatically highlight unusual trends (e.g., sudden increase in missing trade mappings or delayed batch timings).



4. Automated Run Summary Reports

After each batch completion, the GenAI service generates a structured and readable summary email/report for the team and stakeholders.



5. Integration Points

Data sources: Batch logs, metadata tables, status tables, historical summary files.

Tech stack: Python microservice with LangChain/RAG pipeline, vector database (FAISS/Chroma), and LLM API (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Anthropic).

Frontend access: Angular-based dashboard or Slack/Teams bot interface.




Expected Outcome

Reduction in manual log review and issue triage time.

Faster batch issue detection and contextual understanding.

A knowledge base of historical runs accessible in natural language.

Foundation for business-level insights in the next phase.

Phase 2: Business Intelligence Layer

Vision

Provide a conversational analytics layer that allows business users to interact with stress test results and liquidity metrics through natural language, enabling deeper insights and faster decision-making.

Key Objectives

1. Scenario Comparison and Impact Explanation

Enable queries like:
“Compare FedSA and CCAE scenarios for derivative book positions.”
“What drove the liquidity change between scenarios last quarter?”

GenAI will retrieve underlying data, compute differences, and narratively summarize insights.



2. Automated Liquidity Commentary Generation

Generate textual commentary in business-friendly language summarizing daily or weekly reports:
“Liquidity improved 3% under the active scenario due to reduced short-term borrowings.”



3. Interactive Q&A Bot for Business Users

Chat interface integrated with Angular frontend to explore:

Scenario performance

Position or exposure trends

Stress factor impacts




4. Historical Context Understanding

RAG model extended with historical scenario runs, so users can ask questions like:
“When was the last time we saw a similar stress pattern?”
“How has the RLEN distribution evolved over the last 6 months?”



5. Integration Points

Use existing unified position and stress result datasets as RAG sources.

Python API layer connects to the business GenAI model and returns summarized insights.




Expected Outcome

Faster interpretation of complex stress results.

Reduction in dependency on manual report reading.

Enhanced decision support for the Liquidity and Risk teams.

Human-like explanations for non-technical stakeholders.
