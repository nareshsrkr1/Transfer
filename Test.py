Slide 6: Agentic AI – Towards Autonomous Reasoning
Autonomous agents: LLMs with goals, memory, planning, and tool-use that can operate in loops until objectives are met.

Characteristics:
Goal-oriented, reflective, iterative; can run with minimal user input while keeping state/memory across steps.

Applications:

Research assistants coordinating multi-source synthesis.

Automated coding with tool chains and tests.

Financial planning agents that retrieve policies, compute metrics, and draft evidence-backed outputs.

Demo – Live Demo Flow (What to show)
Traditional: ask a domain question; note fluency but no citations or specific policy grounding.

RAG: same question; display cited snippets from knowledge base for auditability.

Agentic RAG: a multi-part task; show retrieval_needed decision and iterative retrieval improving completeness.

Agentic AI: add tool use (e.g., calculator), planning, and memory to deliver a final, cited, computed result with minimal prompting.
