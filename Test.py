RAG – Injecting Fresh, Relevant Knowledge into AI

Problem with Generative AI:
Knowledge is static → can’t access the latest information
Can’t reference internal or proprietary documents without retraining

Solution Combine Search + Generation

How RAG works:
User query → AI sends it to a Retriever
Retriever searches a knowledge source (vector database, document store)
Relevant documents are fetched
AI generates the answer using both its pretrained knowledge + retrieved context

Benefits:
Access to up-to-date info
Domain-specific knowledge without retraining
Keeps responses accurate and grounded in real data
