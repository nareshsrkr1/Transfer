Got it ✅ — you don’t want to focus on the POC mechanics, but on the use case itself — what problem it solves and how GenAI can make a difference if approved.

Here’s how you can present it clearly as use-case justification points for management or architecture review (not technical setup).

💼 Proposed GenAI Use Case for the 165(d) Wind-Down Application

1. Smart Batch Run Intelligence

Our batch processes unify data from MARS (stress data) and TPD (trades & positions) to create consolidated position data and run stress testing via Transcend.

Currently, monitoring batch runs, analyzing logs, and identifying performance deviations are largely manual.

GenAI can provide automated daily run summaries, detect abnormal patterns (e.g., slow performance or repeated errors), and highlight differences between runs — reducing manual oversight effort drastically.



---

2. Historical Trend Analysis and Insight Retrieval

The system executes multiple runs daily across different scenarios (FedSA, CCAE, etc.).

It’s difficult to quickly answer questions like:

“Which scenario usually takes longest?”

“When did this error last occur?”

“How did total run duration evolve over last month?”


GenAI (via RAG) can store and learn from historical runs, enabling natural language exploration of operational history and trends — something static dashboards can’t easily provide.



---

3. Intelligent Error Understanding

Failures often have technical error messages that require developer interpretation.

GenAI can translate logs into human-readable explanations, e.g.:
“Scenario FedSA failed because MARS stress data was incomplete for repo trades.”

This improves transparency and speeds up issue triage for both technical and business teams.



---

4. Automatic Summary and Reporting Layer

After each batch run, a GenAI summarizer can generate a daily operations report, including:

Key metrics (success/failure counts, average duration).

Comparison to previous day/week.

Highlighted issues or improvements.


These summaries can be auto-sent via email or made available on the dashboard — giving business teams a quick, clear picture of system health.



---

5. Knowledge Layer for Future Scenarios

As the model accumulates more data, it becomes a knowledge base for operational intelligence.

Teams can query it to recall past incidents, performance baselines, or changes after system upgrades — without manually searching through months of logs.



---

6. Foundation for Business Insights (Next Phase)

Once technical summarization is stable, the same framework can extend to business-level GenAI insights, like:

Comparing liquidity impact across scenarios.

Generating business commentary on stress test results.


This bridges the gap between technical operations and business interpretation — building toward a true AI-driven risk insight layer.



---

In Summary

This GenAI use case aims to:

Automate batch run understanding and monitoring

Enable natural-language access to operational history

Reduce manual analysis time and improve accuracy

Lay the groundwork for business-facing intelligence in later phases
