Title: Generative AI – From Pattern Matching to Understanding

Bullet points:

Pretrained Models – trained on massive datasets (books, articles, websites, code)

Examples: GPT, Gemini, Claude

Understands natural language & generates human-like responses

Key shift: Models already know a lot before customization

Can be adapted quickly for new tasks via:

Prompt Engineering (lightweight customization)

Fine-tuning (deeper customization)

Learns patterns, context, and reasoning structures

Limitations:

Knowledge fixed at training time

Cannot access latest or domain-specific data without retraining or augmentation
