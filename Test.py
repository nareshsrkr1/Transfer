Slide 2 – Traditional AI: Task-Specific Intelligence
Title: Traditional AI – Building from Scratch

Bullet points:

Neural Networks: Layers of interconnected nodes

Weight Adjustment: Learning by tuning weights to reduce error

Loss Function: Measures prediction error (MSE, Cross-Entropy, etc.)

Task-specific training: One model, one job

Requires large labeled datasets

Limited to patterns learned in training

Limitations:

No general reasoning

No memory of past interactions

Needs retraining for new tasks
