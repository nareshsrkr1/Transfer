Slide 5: Agentic RAG – Smarter, Goal-Oriented RAG

Content (on slide):

Goes beyond one-shot responses

Multi-step reasoning using tools and memory

Uses an Agent to:

Break down tasks

Plan actions

Retrieve iteratively

Decide next steps

Can correct itself and adapt

More dynamic than static RAG

Visual idea:
A flow showing:
User Query → Agent (Plans & Decides) → Multiple RAG Retrieval Cycles → Final Answer
(Agent is shown as the “brain” that decides when and how to call retrieval multiple times.)
